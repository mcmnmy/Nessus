<h1>Vulnerability Management with Nessus</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project covers vulnerability scanning and remediation through Nessus Essentials. I used Nessus to scan a Virtual Machine (VMWare) and ran credentialed scans to detect vulnerabilities and take action toward remediation. I rescanned to compare before and after to verify remediation. I then downloaded a deprecated version of Firefox on the VM and ran the same credentialed vulnerability scan on the machine. As expected, there was a much greater magnitude of vulnerabilities with the outdated version of Firefox. This was a great visual of how Windows and third-party software can raise vulnerabilities on a machine.
